# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The application is solving the problem of not have enough RomCom book covers in the world. The application solves this problem by allowing users to generate custom RomCom covers through the application. We built the following features: generating a random RomCom cover from a set of arrays, saving those covers to another array, creating a form for users to create their own custom RomCom covers with data validation, saving those custom covers, view all saved covers, and delete any of those saved covers from the saved covers array.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

A user simply needs to fork and clone the repository to use the application. From there, simply open up index.html to use the application.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

We had a total of 5 days to work on the project. We are 2 weeks into the Turing program.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

Both Eric Batiste and Matthew Shindel worked on this application together, specfiically the JS funtionality for the webpage to run.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The goals were to learn about using JS to manipulate a HTML webpage, so that a webpage could then react dynamically to a users input. We used JS, HTML and CSS to accomplish this.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Our major win was completing the viewSavedCovers section of the webpage, specifically iteration 3. Initally, this iteration looked very challenging, but we both worked together very efficently to solve the problem. Additionally, deleting a saved cover from our array was also a challenge, but we solve that as well, using a clever solution of using type coercion on the ID's of the cover.
